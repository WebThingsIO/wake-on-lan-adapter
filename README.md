# wake-on-lan-adapter

Wake-on-LAN adapter for the [Mozilla WebThings Gateway](https://iot.mozilla.org).

## Usage

Normally you will just want to install this from the add-ons list provided by the gateway.

## Configuration

To configure the add-on, i.e. add the devices you'd like to control, navigate to _Settings -> Add-ons_ in the gateway's UI and click the _Configure_ button for the Wake-on-LAN add-on.

You'll then add the MAC addresses you'd like to control and click _Apply_.

After this, your devices should appear when you click the button to add new things on the home screen.
